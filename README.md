Using Natural Language Processing to predict the tone of a review - is it 1 stars or 5 stars based on the vocabulary used?

One of the portfolio projects for the Udemy ML course I am doing.

I have done some extra investigation to try to understand why using TF-IFD transform reduces F1-score, and why recall of bad reviews in particular is bad.
